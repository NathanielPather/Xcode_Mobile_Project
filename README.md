# Xcode_Mobile_Project
An xcode project that I am slowly adding additions to. There is no decided use of this project yet.

The purpose of this project is to grow my xcode and swift swift skills, among others such as github management. Feel free to suggest functionality for me to add. Please keep in mind I'm still fairly new to software development in general.

Functionality:
Person model to template person objects.
Hello button to create person objects, add them to storage, and present them visually.
Storage of people is displayed visually in a table view controller.

Goals:
Goals can be found in ViewController.swift file at the top of the file as a comment. I will also add them here however keep in mind the README.md file may be out of date.

Make table view look nicer.
