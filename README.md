# Xcode_Mobile_Project
An xcode project that I am slowly adding additions to. There is no decided use of this project yet.

The purpose of this project is to grow my xcode and swift swift skills, among others such as github management. Feel free to suggest functionality for me to add. Please keep in mind I'm still fairly new to software development in general.

Functionality:
Person model to template person objects.
Hello button to create person objects, add them to storage, and present them visually.

Goals:
Create view to present all person objects visually. Perhaps in a table view.
